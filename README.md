# LyTomo-Watershed
Characterizing proto-clusters/groups in Lyman-alpha Tomography

The repository for reproducing the results in [Qezlou-Newman-Rudie-Bird 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03930)

### Cookbook :

There is a step-by-step cookbook in [CookBook.ipynb`](https://github.com/mahdiqezlou/LyTomo-Watershed/blob/main/CookBook.ipynb)

### Requirements :

Each part of the production has a different package requirements. 
Please, review the imported packages in each section.

### Generated Data

- The generated data are available here [Comming Soon!]
- Refer to the `CookBook.ipynb` to see which data you need at each step. 

A list of available data :

1. The data displayed on each figure.
2. 20 Mock observed maps (resolution (1cMpc/h)^3)
3. Noiseless maps for 3 redshifts

Note : The observed LATIS data[Newman et.al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10676) is not publicly released yet. 
       Please stay tuned for a near future paper!

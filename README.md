# LyTomo-Watershed
Characterizing proto-clusters/groups in Lyman-alpha Tomography

The repository for reproducing the results in [Qezlou et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03930)

### Cookbook :

There is a step-by-step cookbook in [`CookBook.ipynb`](https://github.com/mahdiqezlou/LyTomo-Watershed/blob/main/CookBook.ipynb)

### Requirements :

Each part of the production has a different package requirements. 
Please, review the imported packages in each section.

### Generated Data

- The generated data are available here [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5770883.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5770883). 
- Refer to the `CookBook.ipynb` to see which data you need at each step. 
- A clear descitption of each file is provided on the Zenodo website. 
- After downloading the desired compressed files, please decompress them in a directory named `LyTomo_data` outside this repository. So, it should look like this:

```
./LyTomo-Wtershed/
     codes/
     *.ipynb
./LyTomo_data/
     descendants/
     mock_maps_z2.4/
     ...
```
 Then you can use codes and notebooks exactly where they are. 




If you have any questions please send me an email : mahdi.qezlou@email.ucr.edu or raise an issue here!

Note : The observed LATIS data [Newman et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10676) is not publicly released yet. 
       Please stay tuned for a near future paper!
